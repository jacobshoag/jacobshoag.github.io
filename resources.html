        <p>I took the AP Stats exam in 9th grade. I used the Numworks calculator on the exam, which is by far and away the best calculator for any standardized tests. It makes operations so easy to follow and understand. The College Board doesn't require you to clear memory before the exam. The NumWorks calculator is approved and allows for the uploading of scripts (with very limited memory). I created a bunch of Python "scripts" that contained helpful notes for the AP Stats exam, formatted in a way that would display well on the Numworks calculator. I didn't wind up using them on the exam, but you might find them helpful. They are contained here:</p>

        <h3>AP Microeconomics: The Exam Has it Wrong</h3>
        <p>When I was studying for the AP Micro exam in 8th grade, I had a hard time understanding the review book's explanation of deadweight loss for price floors and price ceilings. I assumed that it was my mistake, but it's actually an error in the College Board's treatment of the subject. Take a look at the following question (from p. 135 here <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-microeconomics-course-and-exam-description.pdf" target="_blank">College Board Course and Exam Description</a>). An image is below:</p>
        <img src="assets/images/college_board_micro_q.jpg" alt="College Board AP Microeconomics Question">

        <p>The College Board says the correct answer is E. That assumes, though, that even with a price floor or a price ceiling, the highest value purchasers or sellers will still get to transact. That isn't necessarily the case. A paper by Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) (<a href="https://users.nber.org/~luttmer/rentcontrol.pdf" target="_blank">link to paper</a>) shows that if things are allocated randomly with price controls, then the deadweight loss could be much higher!</p>
        <img src="assets/images/Glaeser_Luttmer.jpg" alt="Glaeser and Luttmer Paper Insights">

        <p>What should you do? Well, I recommend just answering things the way the College Board would like you to answer. However, if this confused you like it confused me, it's helpful to know you're not wrong. The College Board's solution depends on a really non-obvious assumption that is probably incorrect.</p>
