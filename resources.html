               <h2>Word Ladder Game</h2>

        <p>
            I'm an **AP Computer Science student**, and as part of developing my Python skills, I coded up a fun word-swap game.
        </p>

        <p>
            The **Word Ladder game** challenges you to transform one word into another, changing **one letter at a time**. Each intermediate word must be a real word.  
            For example, you can go from <strong>CAT ‚Üí COT ‚Üí DOT ‚Üí DOG</strong>, but not <strong>CAT ‚Üí CAG ‚Üí DAG ‚Üí DOG</strong> because "CAG" and "DAG" are not real words.
        </p>

        <p>
            üéØ The **game gets harder as you go**!  
            - Your first puzzle might only require **two or three** steps.  
            - As you solve more, the game will **increase the difficulty** by selecting word pairs that require **longer transformation chains**.  
            - Eventually, you'll need to find **5, 6, or even 10-step transformations!**  
        </p>

        <h3>‚¨áÔ∏è Download the Python Version</h3>
        <p>
            This game runs in Python. You can download the script and the necessary word list below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="assets/scripts/word_swap_jshoag.py" download>Download Python Script</a></li>
            <li><a href="assets/other/corncob_lowercase.txt" download>Download Common Word List</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üìå How to Run the Game</h3>
        <p>
            1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure you have **Python 3 installed** on your computer.  
            2Ô∏è‚É£ Download the **Python script** and the **dictionary file** above.  
            3Ô∏è‚É£ Place both files in the same folder.  
            4Ô∏è‚É£ Open a **terminal or command prompt** and navigate to the folder.  
            5Ô∏è‚É£ Run this command:
                    <pre>
python word_swap_jshoag.py
        </pre>
        </p>
          <p>
            You can also try the game below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="word-ladder.html" class="button">Play the Word Ladder Game</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The game will start in your terminal, and you can enter words to play.

        <p>
            I am attempting to organize a trip to visit Mexico City and learn more about the history and strength of Mexico's Jewish community. The trip would take place in late May.

        <h2>AP Microeconomics: The Exam Has it Wrong</h2>
<p>
    When I was studying for the AP Micro exam in 8th grade, I had a hard time understanding the review book's explanation of deadweight loss for price floors and price ceilings. I assumed that it was my mistake, but it's actually an error in the College Board's treatment of the subject. Take a look at the following question (from p. 135 here <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-microeconomics-course-and-exam-description.pdf" target="_blank">College Board Course and Exam Description</a>). An image is below:
</p>

<p>
    The College Board says the correct answer is E. That assumes, though, that even with a price floor or a price ceiling, the highest value purchasers or sellers will still get to transact. That isn't necessarily the case. A paper by Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) (<a href="https://users.nber.org/~luttmer/rentcontrol.pdf" target="_blank">link to paper</a>) shows that if things are allocated randomly with price controls, then the deadweight loss could be much higher!
</p>

<p>
    What should you do? Well, I recommend just answering things the way the College Board would like you to answer. However, if this confused you like it confused me, it's helpful to know you're not wrong. The College Board's solution depends on a really non-obvious assumption that is probably incorrect.
