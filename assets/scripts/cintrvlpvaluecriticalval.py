Confidence Interval
----
The 95 percent confidence level
means that if we repeatedly 
took random samples 
of the same size from the 
population and constructed a 
95 percent confidence interval 
from each sample, then in the
long run 95 percent of those 
intervals would contain 
the actual value of 
the population parameter ("of 
households own a dog") 
**
For 95% of the samples, their
95%-CI will contain the pop
mean.
-----
P-Value

If the null is true, this is
the probability of seeing a
sample value this far or
farther from the null value.

--------
Critical Value alpha

This is the threshold for 
"rare" we set. If a p-value
is below the critical value,
we say its too rare given
the null...so rare we should
reject the null.

------
Least Squares Line
minimizes the sum of the
residuals squared.
