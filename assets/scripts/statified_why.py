One statistical advantage of 
using stratified random 
sampling as opposed to simple 
random sampling is, for example,
if members of the strata 
have more similar value to
each other than across groups.
If so, then for the same sample
size a more accurate and precise
estimateof the overall
proportion may result. Another 
advantage is that stratified 
random sampling guarantees 
that each of strata will have
some representation.
