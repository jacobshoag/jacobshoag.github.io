* How to do randomization
-----------------------------
*Simple Random
---
Obtain a list of all 7,000 
students. Assign an ID number 
from 1 to 7,000 to
each student.

Use computer to 
generate 500 random integers 
between 1 and 7,000 without
replacement. The students 
whose ID numbers match 
those numbers are 
selected for the sample. If 
non-unique numbers are
generated, the repeated numbrs 
are ignored until 500 unique 
numbers are obtained. 
---
*Equal numbers
---
Using 15 equally sized slips 
of paper, label five slips
with: 0 ml, five slips with
1 ml, & five slips with 2ml.

Mix the slips of paper 
in a hat. For each
container, select a slip of 
paper from the hat 
(without replacement) and
spray that container with the
treatment selected.
---
* Matched Pair
---
For each pair of twins, label
one as twin A and label the 
other as twin B. For each pair
of twins, toss a coin. If the 
coin lands on heads,
twin A gets the placebo and 
twin B gets the active
drug. If the coin lands on 
tails, twin A gets the
active drug and twin B gets 
the placebo

* Clustered Random
---
The following two-step process 
can be used to select the eight
apartments.

Step 1: Generate a random 
integer from 1 and 9, 
using a computer. Select all 
four apartments on the floor 
corresponding to the selected
integer.

Step 2: Generate another 
random integer from 1 and 9, 
inclusive. If it is the same 
as a prior integer 
continue generating random 
integers from 1 and 9 until 
a different one appears. 
Again select all four 
apartments on the floor 
matching the second 
selected integer. The cluster
sample consists of the eight 
apartments on the two randomly 
selected floors.
