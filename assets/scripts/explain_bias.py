* Explaining Bias
------------

* Need to explain why sample
would be different from pop.

* Need to explain direction of
difference (sample>pop or 
sample<pop). OK to make
assumptions.

* Not enough to just say more
accurate.

*Pressure say yes AND DONT
ACTUALLY RECYCLE

* Need to say alzheimer=1 if
yes AND 0 if no.

* Experiment=assign treatment
Observational=use existing data

* Need to say assign treat and
assign placebo! 

*Need to say "Will measure Y"
as a step if designing 
experiment

* Confounding:
  Need to say X2->Y
  and X2-> X
  explain if -> is increases
  or decreases

Example:

Journals introduce response
bias due to the self-reporting
by subjects who have a poor 
memory of the amount of walking. 
If most people who keep journals
underreport their miles
because they forget,
then the estimate of mean 
miles walked for the target 
population will be
biased too low. Trackers would likely
be a more accurate record 
of miles by subjects and 
closer to pop mean.
