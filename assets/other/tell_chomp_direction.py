How to figure out >,< or not eq

Key things:

True Mean/p or Null Mean/p:   A
Cut-Off/Danger Level:         B
Sample Mean/p:                C
Claim (if there)              D
claim will be ignored

Look for:
"or less" "or more" 
"greater than"
"smaller than" "exceeds"
"below"

HIGHLIGHT THEM!
Sets the carrot
for rejecting.

If there's a cutoff value then
its almost always going to be
> or <. 

Ask: would I reject if sample 
is bigger than cutoff or 
smaller than cutoff?

If bigger, reject is Z >
If smaller, reject is Z<

BUT THEN CHECK IF THEY 
WANT REJECT OR FAIL TO 
REJECT

Example 1: 
Store claims 47 min. Planner
draw n=225 sample and will 
reject if sample mean exceeds
50. The true is 51 and SD=27

Claim: 47 min.
Cutoff: 50 min
True: 51 min.

Odds of rejecting?
P(Z>(cutoff-true/null)/sd)
P( Z> (50-51)/27/sqrt(225))

*****************************
Means odds that a new sample's
Z score will exceed this one
*****************************

Odds of failing to reject?
P(Z<(cutoff-null)/sd/sqrt(n))
P( Z<(50-51)/27/sqrt(225))

WRITE THE PROB OF BOTH 
REJECT AND FAIL TO REJECT
THEN MATCH TO QUESTION
*******************************
Example 2:
Army will test a sample of
400 and reject if sample mean
is less than 4. Odds of failing
to reject?

Claim: 4.3
Cutoff: 4
True: 4.2

"Less than" -> reject P(z< )

Odds of rejecting
P(Z<(cutoff-null)/sd/sqrt(n)))
P(Z<(4-4.2)/sd))

Odds of failing to reject
P(Z>(cutoff-null)/sd/sqrt(n)))
P(Z>(4-4.2)/sd))

----------
Example 3:
Claim 2.8
Cutoff 2.5
True 2.4

"will reject if sample mean
is less than"...
reject = P(z< t)
=P(z<(cutoff-true)/sd/sqrt(n))"
------------------
Example 4:
Safe if 24.5 or less
Sample 25.3
What is Ha to
address concerns?

Hypothesis means no sample!
So must involve 24.5 not 25.3!
Concerned its above that so
H0: mu<=24.5
Ha: mu>24.5
---------------
Example 5:
Car says MPG is 35+
Worried overstating
***
OVERSTATING MEANS
Ha: Mu<35

UNDERSTATING MEANS
HA: mu>35

Here understating
H0: mu=35
Ha: mu<35
