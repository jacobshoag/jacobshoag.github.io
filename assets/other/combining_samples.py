----------------------------
* Combining Means
* this works if adding 
* 1 observation too!
----------------------------
Have data with 100
observations and a mean of 7
and another data with 25 
obs and a mean of 3.

Adding up the first 100 gives 
a total of 700. We know that 
adding up 25 gives a tptal of
75. So combined have 775.

Combining have 125 observations. 
So new mean =775/125=6.2.

Have
(100/125)*7 + (25/125)*3=6.2

Give 4 bros $20 raises
mean $5.
----------------------------

If we raise a point above the
it the median doesnt change.
The mean and standard dev do!

Mean, St.Dev, Slope are 
SENSITIVE TO OUTLIERS

IQR, MEDIAN, Quantiles are
RESISTANT to OUTLIERS
