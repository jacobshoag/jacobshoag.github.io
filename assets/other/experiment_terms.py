Terms for collecting data
*****************************

Blocking:
Group sample members before 
ASSIGNING treatment and control
It makes sure T and C
are representative.
Get equal whites & blacks in
suntan lotion/placebo group.
Like stratified but for 
assignment.
Matched twin is example

Cause:
When changing one causes the
other to change.

Census;
A survey of the whole pop
Dont need confidnce intrvl
or t-test cause you aren't 
sampling. Its everyone!

Control Group:
Get no treatment or the 
baseline comparison.

Convenience Sampling:
Just choose people who are
easy to interview. 

Counfounded
* Variable Z that screws up 
cause and correlation. Like 
heat and summer with sharks and
ice cream. Can't tell what is 
causing the slope or differenc.
Explain how Z impacts X and 
Z impacts Y

Correlation:
When one variable predicts anoth

Cluster Sampling:
Take a pond and collect many 
there.

Double Blind: 
Neither the person
nor the data collector knows 
who's treatment and control.

Experiment: Only way to prove
cause and effect.

Experimental Unit:
What gets treated. A person or 
a container of bugs or a state.

Explanatory Variable:
The X or independent variable 
or treatment being changed.

Factors: 
What you change in an experimnt

Non-Response Bias:
People do not answer survey

Parameter: 
A data value in the
population

Placebo:
Sugar bill due to psych effect

Prospective:
Creating data looking forward

Random Assignment:
Randomize who is samp gets 
treatment or control. 
Helps with saying treatment
CAUSES y.

Random Sampling:
Helps get a representive sampl
Random who in pop is in samp.

Randomized Blocking Design:
First divide sample into 
groups  based on a trait 
(boy/girl) that could affect 
the response. Then you randoml
assign to subjects from each 
group to treatments.

Response Bias:
Anything that causes  survey
design to have an effect on the
estimate.

Replication:
Repeating your results to make
sure its not due to change.

Representative:
Sample looks like population

Retrospective:
Using already existing data

Sampling Frame:
The people who could be chosen
for the sample. Like if 
no email then not be 
in sampling frame.

Sampling Variability: 
How much the sample avg. 
differs every time you take
a new sample

Single blind:
Only the participants don't 
know treatment/control

Statistic:
A data value like a mean in the
sample. Sample word for a 
parameter.

Statistically Significant:
When, if the null is true, we'd
see these results very 
infrequen due to chance.

Simple Random Sample:
Everyone and every group has 
same odds. Hard. Need a 
complete list of population.

Systematic sampling:
Every 50th person

Stratified Sampling:
Split into groups (boy/girl)
and then draw from group.
Helps make sure all groups in.


Undercoverage bias:
Some people not sampled. Like
they have no cell phones.

Voluntary Response Bias
Some people wont respond and 
their answers are different
from average.
