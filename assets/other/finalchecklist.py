* 7 Final Checks Before
* HANDING IT IN. Mazal.
**************************
1) Are there any questions
where you did not write in
the units? 

DO A CAREFUL CHECK!

2) Look at each question.
Does it say "compare" or
"advantage" or "more than" 
or something like that? 
If so make sure
you have COMPARATIVE LANGUAGE
(greater, less than, etc.)
and show both results!

DO A CAREFUL CHECK!

3) Is there anywhere else you
can show work? Calculate a
t-statistic? Write a formula?
Does it say "Show your work"
or "Justify your answer"?

DO A CAREFUL CHECK!

4) Does it CAUSE anywhere in
any question? Was it a 
randomized experiment? If not
you should say bias. CAUSE!

Do A CAREFUL CHECK!

5) Read your answers aloud
to yourself. Do you say "it"
shows when you mean "the graph"
or something like that?

Try to take out the "its".

6) Use careful language like
"roughly" for things like
linear, strong, aprox. values.

7) Read any experiment thing
twice. Any detail you can add:
shake hat, give placebo, 
y=0 if not, etc.
